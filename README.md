# CD(A)I
CD-AI is a B2B SaaS solution that helps hospitals and health systems automatically analyze unstructured clinical notes, spot missing or vague documentation, and suggest precise, revenue-impacting edits. By integrating seamlessly with existing EHRs, the platform improves coding accuracy (ICD-10/CPT), reduces denials, and accelerates reimbursementâ€”all while enhancing patient-care data quality.
